    <h1>League of <span class="un">Evil Exes</span> Form</h1>
    <p> Greetings fellow exes and soon to be business partners. 
        Your presence means that you've read my post on Craigslist, but I am going to give a refresher anyway since I love telling you about myself. 
        I am <span class="trois">Gideon Graves</span>, owner of Toronto's <span class="trois">Chaos Theatre</span>. It's not much, I know. 
        Upon thou I bestow a chance at redemption through <span class="deux">revenge</span>. 
        Do keep in mind that we are or will very soon be the League of Ramona Flower's Evil Exes, not just any exes(4chan is where you want to be.) 
        Our mission is to inflict as much pain as possible onto Flowers. And also kill Scott Pilgrim. Do not forget about that last part. 
        I will reimburse you on travel costs depending on your competence and life. I doubt that any of you will die, but that is a sacrifice I'm willing to make. 
        Hell, it's a sacrifice we're willing to make together.</p>
